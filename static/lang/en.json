    "philosophy_text_1": "There are no true guerrilla games today, except for war-sims that feel like a second job. Guerrilla warfare means studying topography, military tactics, logistics. Not improvising.",
    "philosophy_quote": "\"THE WAR IS FOUGHT FOR THE HOMELAND; GUERRILLA WARFARE, FOR ANOTHER HOMELAND\"",
    "philosophy_text_2": "The Garibaldi brigades were not bands of outlaw rebels. They were like organized armies with political commissars, hierarchical structures, training schools. This game challenges you to build that same organization. From almost nothing.",

    "pain1_text": "Whether you're an unstoppable Assassin or a supersoldier against an entire army like in <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, your actions often lack real weight in the world. In <em>Viva l'Italia</em>, you are not a ghost. Every victory or defeat impacts your brigade's prestige, attracting or deterring new recruits. You are a leader, not a one-man army.",
    "pain2_title": "STEALTH OPTIONAL?",
    "pain2_text": "In many games, getting caught just turns the mission into a shooter. In <em>Viva l'Italia</em>, triggering an alarm is not a style choice: it means overwhelming reinforcements will arrive, forcing a retreat or sealing your death. The question isn't 'how do you want to play?' but 'how will you survive?'",
    "pain3_title": "A PUZZLE WITH ONE SOLUTION?",
    "pain3_text": "Too many levels, like in older <em>Medal of Honor</em> campaigns, are just disguised corridors. Here, each mission offers multiple paths, and the intel you gather from your network of contacts can reveal unexpected opportunities. Replayability isn't a feature; it's the core of the experience.",

Our goal is to create a mature, historically informed interactive work, far from any superficial or controversial rhetoric.",
    "game_s1_text2": "This is not a glorification of violence, but a reflection on the difficult choices, courage, and organization of the men and women who fought for freedom. The gameplay, focused on infiltration and strategy, is intended to reward cunning and planning, not reckless action.",

For those unfamiliar, <em>\"Gioventù Ribelle\"</em> was a 2011 video game tied to the 150th anniversary of ITALY's unification, but its development made it an <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF4P3jiHED4 target=\"_blank\">international embarrassment</a>.",

    "game_s3_text1": "Let's be blunt: don't expect AA graphics. Our resources are limited. Expect graphics that look at least 10 years old. Our energy has been invested in features more timeless than polygons—the core gameplay.",
